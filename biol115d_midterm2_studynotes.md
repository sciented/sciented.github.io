   4. What is the **``endosymbiont hypothesis``**? 

      - ``Plain English``: ==Eukaryotic== ==organelles== used to live on their own *outside the eukaryotic cell membrane* as ==prokaryotes== (e.g. ==mitochondria== used to be an  <span style="background:powderblue">aerobic</span>[^1] <span style="background:lightpink">proteobacterium</span> which was more or less absorbed into the eukaryotic cell). ([Source](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Microbiology/Microbiology_(Kaiser)/Unit_4%3A_Eukaryotic_Microorganisms_and_Viruses/07%3A_The_Eukaryotic_Cell/7.8%3A_The_Endosymbiotic_Theory#:~:text=Solutions-,The%20endosymbiotic%20theory%20states%20that%20some%20of%20the%20organelles%20in,which%20is%20circular%2C%20not%20linear.))

   5. What **evidence** is consistent with the ``endosymbiont hypothesis``?

   6. How has the diversity of life varied through *time*?

      1. Evolution (genetic changes over time)
         - Homologous[^2] Evolution
           - Anatomical
           - Molecular
         - Convergent[^3] Evolution
           - Seemingly common phenotypical[^4] features were ==independently evolved== by ``adaptation`` and ``selection pressure(s)`` over incomprehensibly long periods of time through innumerable iterations of ``gain-of-function`` based on ==survival advantage== and ==random genetic mutation==.
      2. Geologic Change and Mass Extinction Events
         1. Natural Selection
      3. Artificial Selection

   7. **Cambrian Explosion & Mass Extinction Questions**

      1. What was the **``Cambrian Explosion``**?

            - ==~530 million years ago==.
         2. *Why* is the ``Cambrian Explosion`` considered so significant to *subsequent evolution*? 
            - Over the course of just 10-20 million years life on earth rapidly evolved from the way it had existed for 1—2 billion years as nothing more than simple multicellular organisms to far more complex organisms.
            - Within ~225 million years of the Cambrian Explosion life on earth evolved from fungi and marine eukaryotes to dinosaurs and (following the K-T mass extinction caused by the impact of a ~10 mile wide asteroid impact) *mammals* (including primates) and *birds*.
            - It has been ~500 million years since the Cambrian Explosion but the earth is ~4,500,000 billion years old
      2. What is a ``mass extinction``?

      2. When was the most recent mass extinction (not counting the present mass extinction)? 
         1. What notable species went extinct at the time of that *most recent* ``(not present)`` mass extinction? 
         2. What is thought to have been the **cause** of that ``most recent`` mass extinction? 
            1. What is the **evidence** for that hypothesis?

   9. What ``features`` or circumstances make species particularly susceptible to **extinction**? ``Note: Study PPT to ensure proper use of "features."``

2. **Geologic Drivers of Evolution**

   ##### Peter's Pre-Question Notes:

   > "Imagine a situation where at one time a species has only one population, then later a second population forms. 
   >
   > - Imagine the two populations are initially in separate locations but later have overlapping ranges, as might happen, for example, if their ``ranges`` expand. 
   > - While separated, the two populations would evolve independently in response to the circumstances where they each occur. 
   >
   > - If such a process continues for a sufficient time, one or both populations may become different species, but there will be a ``gray area`` between the time where the two populations are definitely members of the **same species** and later when there are clearly **two different species**."

   1. **Question**: What are some of the ``mechanisms`` that could **prevent interbreeding** among members of the two populations ``during that interim`` when the populations have ``diverged somewhat`` *but are not [yet] obviously two different species*?

      5. Which ape species are most closely related to humans?

   2. **Emergence of Bipedalism in Human Ancestors**

      1. **Two Hypotheses**
         1. Explain the *leading* hypothesis to account for the rise of bipedalism in human ancestors
         2. Explain the hypothesis regarding the subsequent **interplay** between ``bipedalism``, ``tool use``, and ``selection for intelligence``. 
            1. What did ``climate change`` have to do with the emergence of bipedalism, tool use, and selection for intelligence? 

   3. **Phylogenesis & Phylogenetic Drivers of Genus Homo Speciation**

      ```Note: "Phylogenesis" is the point at which there is a branching off of a new species from a common ancestor.``

      1. What genus was the **ancestor** to the ``genus`` *Homo*? 
         1. Approximately when did that genus occur? ``Note: I think Peter means to ask "Approximately when did the phylogenetic branching off occur between the genus Homo and its common ancestor?"``
      2. When did the first members of genus Homo arise? 
         1. Where have the earliest fossils been found of the *Homo* ``genus``? 
      3. Approximately *when* did the various Homo species reach "other continents"? (``Note: I think Peter means to ask "other continents beyond Africa"``.) 
      4. What is the ``relationship`` of *Homo* **sapiens** to *Homo* **neanderthalis**? 
      5. What is the *most recently discovered* ``species`` of [the] *Homo* [genus]? 
      6. Is there any ``biological basis`` for the concept of human ``races``?

   4. **Human Population Sustainability**

      1. How ==large== is the ``human population``? 
      2. What is the history of the growth of the human population? 

      1. What are ``Herman Daly’s guidelines for sustainability`` 
         1. What is the logic behind ``Herman Daly’s guidelines for sustainability``? 
         2. Are we respecting ``Dr. Daly’s guidelines for sustainability``? 
            1. What is your evidence that we are respecting/disrespecting ``Dr. Daly's guidelines for sustainability``?

            - A biome is a component of nature consisting of plants and animals situated in a ``biome type`` (see below) such as a forest, ocean, lake, prairie, swamp, etc.
         2. What are the major ``biome types``? 
            1. Aquatic
            2. Grassland
            3. Forest
            4. Desert
            5. Tundra
         3. What are the basic characteristics of each ``major biome``?
         4. How do **climatic factors** affect the *distribution* of biomes
         5. Which [climatic] factors are *most* important [``re: their effect on the distribution of biomes``]? 


      **Climates & Seasons**

      1. What are the various factors that determine the **distribution** of *temperature* and *precipitation* around the planet? 
      2. Why are there ``seasons`` on Earth? 
      3. What is a ``Hadley Cell``? ==Read below for the answer==
         1. Explain the ``air`` and ``moisture`` *movement* associated with Hadley Cells. 
            1. Explanation of air movement associated with Hadley Cells.
               - ==Movement (specifically **wind circulation** caused by **convection**==, which just means ``a transfer of heat energy`` caused by hot, less dense air/vapor/moisture **rising** from the relatively hotter equator and slamming into the relatively colder (and by colder we mean **more dense**) air/vapor/moisture which is being ==pulled down by gravity==. 
               - When rising hot air and falling cold air collide, **heat energy is exchanged** and this exchange is movement-based.
                 - It’s all about the two different ***air pressures*** and ***air densities***:
                   - Hot *equatorial* air *rising* = **High** Pressure & **Low** Density; Cold 30-degrees *northern and southern* air *falling* = **Low** Pressure & **High** Density.  
                   - **Think about shaking up a Dr. Pepper and opening it…what happens?**
                     - The high pressure soda explodes out of the can into the much lower pressure air around the can, right?
                     - The same thing happens in these Hadley Cells.
                       - The hot equatorial air(†) rises up and hits the falling cold Tropics air(†)…and that (†) symbol is there to tell you **it’s not really just “air”** but it’s **a huge cloud of hot water vapor** *exploding* like the soda can into the low pressure cold zones around the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. **This is literally the definition of “a convection cycle”** which causes both **wind and rain** to move and fall.
                       - The **wind** is caused by the *hot high pressure air being sucked into the colder air zones around the Tropics*.
                       - The **moisture** is *rain* and **rain is the earth’s equivalent of water droplets on the outside of a soda can.**
                         - The hot water vapor filled air condenses on the “soda can” of the Tropics *cold air* and clouds form and get saturated with this water until the droplets are *so heavy* **they fall to earth due to gravity** ==aka **rain**==.
               - **<span style="background:powderblue">Hadley Cells</span>** are just really big <span style="background:violet">convection zones</span> located within 30 degrees north or south of the equator ==where rising hot air meets falling cold air==.
               - These Hadley Cells are located essentially at the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn or ~30 degrees north and south of the equator.
            2. Explanation of moisture movement associated with Hadley Cells.
               - **The earth’s “air” is really a vapor cloud** consisting of ==water vapor== so when the cold air at the Tropics hits the hot equatorial air **the hot air rapidly cools** and forms **==condensation==** (just like how water droplets appear on the outside of an ice-cold Dr. Pepper can after you open it). 

1. What is a ``mountain rain shadow`` and why do they occur? 
   1. What is the **significance** of ``mountain rain shadows`` for the **``distribution``** of biomes? 
   2. How do ``coastal`` climates **compare** to ``inland (continental)`` climates? 
      1. How does [``the``] comparison [``between coastal and inland/continental climates``] **differ** between *summer* and *winter*? 
   
5. Why is Europe *so much warmer* than Hudson’s Bay, Canada, ``even though the two are at the`` **``same latitude``**?

3. How have **humans** affected the *distribution* of biomes?

##### Comments from the Perspective of a *Teacher* (Not Peter's Comments)

1. What is the **key feature** of all scientific research/inquiry which differentiates it from all other types of human thought?

   ``Peter directly addresses this issue on p. 384 of the merged notes.``

   1. *The thing students **never** seem to quite understand*: The goal of all scientific research is to **``prove a given hypothesis is wrong.``**
      1. An example hypothesis helps: 
         1. **Example Hypothesis 1**: "The location of most of Texas' endangered gray hawks, the Rio Grande Valley, places the Texas gray hawk at high risk of lethal infection by the HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus **because** the Texas gray hawk's primary location lies directly in the path of the Central North American Flyway of migratory birds infected with HPAI H5N1."
         2. Most students would take that hypothesis and **go out searching for research which *supports* the hypothesis**.
            1. This "``prove the hypothesis right``" method of research is ***entirely wrong***. 
            2. This incorrect method is *completely* backwards!
   2. Now it's time to introduce the concept of a ``null hypothesis`` and its opposite, the ``alternate hypothesis``.
      1. Using Example Hypothesis 1 from above, the stated hypothesis is *actually* the ``alternate hypothesis``.
         1. The **``null hypothesis``** requires you to restate Example Hypothesis 1 as follows: 
            1. **Example *Null* Hypothesis 1:**
               1. "The location of the Texas gray hawk in the path of the migratory flyway **does *not*** place these hawks at high risk of lethal HPAI H5N1 2.3.4.4b viral infection."
      2. Your goal as a scientist and researcher is to do your very best to **prove yourself wrong** (Peter explains this on p. 387 of the merged notes); stated another way, your goal is to **prove the null hypothesis true**, i.e., to prove that your stated (``alternate``) hypothesis **false** (thereby proving the ``null`` hypothesis **true**). **This is the *essence* of science**.
         1. Stated another way, your goal is to prove the stated hypothesis is *wrong* and if you *fail to prove the stated hypothesis wrong* then you can state that you have **failed to prove the null hypothesis true** to some degree or within some margin of statistical error (typically less than 5% probability that your conclusion is wrong).
         2. You **never** claim you have conclusively proven your original hypothesis 100% true.
         3. This is ``scientific humility`` or ``scientific conservatism``. 
         4. So much scientific research (and writing) is done improperly, failing completely to follow the above *central* motivation, it's quite disheartening. 
            1. The problem, from my viewpoint, is a misplaced confusion between scientific writing and *persuasive writing* as the latter is taught in K-12 education. 
            2. We teach students to state their thesis in the intro and then support the thesis in the body and restate the thesis in the conclusion. **This is wrong**.
            3. ``Selection bias`` i.e. choosing to cite only research studies which support the proposition that your stated (``alternate``) hypothesis is **true** is the most common and pervasive problem I see when I read dozens of articles about a given topic. Hardly any of the papers attempt to prove their hypotheses wrong because there is a ``negative human emotional association`` that comes into play: Basically, research which succeeds at proper scientific inquiry ``doesn't get published`` as much as so-called "positive" research because **according to the major publishers, readers don't like to read negative results**. This is absolutely ridiculous (the thing which I find ridiculous is that science is willing to bend to market pressures and dilute its integrity so more professors can get more papers published more often in more journals...it's a massive scam [see the book *Profscam* for more elaboration])
