<li>Why are there <code>seasons</code> on Earth?</li>
<li>What is a <code>Hadley Cell</code>? ==Read below for the answer==
<ol type="1">
<li>Explain the <code>air</code> and <code>moisture</code> <em>movement</em> associated with Hadley Cells.
<ol type="1">
<li>Explanation of air movement associated with Hadley Cells.
<ul>
<li>==Movement (specifically <strong>wind circulation</strong> caused by <strong>convection</strong>==, which just means <code>a transfer of heat energy</code> caused by hot, less dense air/vapor/moisture <strong>rising</strong> from the relatively hotter equator and slamming into the relatively colder (and by colder we mean <strong>more dense</strong>) air/vapor/moisture which is being ==pulled down by gravity==.</li>
<li>When rising hot air and falling cold air collide, <strong>heat energy is exchanged</strong> and this exchange is movement-based.
<ul>
<li>It’s all about the two different <strong><em>air pressures</em></strong> and <strong><em>air densities</em></strong>:
<ul>
<li>Hot <em>equatorial</em> air <em>rising</em> = <strong>High</strong> Pressure &amp; <strong>Low</strong> Density; Cold 30-degrees <em>northern and southern</em> air <em>falling</em> = <strong>Low</strong> Pressure &amp; <strong>High</strong> Density.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Think about shaking up a Dr. Pepper and opening it…what happens?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The high pressure soda explodes out of the can into the much lower pressure air around the can, right?</li>
<li>The same thing happens in these Hadley Cells.
<ul>
<li>The hot equatorial air(†) rises up and hits the falling cold Tropics air(†)…and that (†) symbol is there to tell you <strong>it’s not really just “air”</strong> but it’s <strong>a huge cloud of hot water vapor</strong> <em>exploding</em> like the soda can into the low pressure cold zones around the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. <strong>This is literally the definition of “a convection cycle”</strong> which causes both <strong>wind and rain</strong> to move and fall.</li>
<li>The <strong>wind</strong> is caused by the <em>hot high pressure air being sucked into the colder air zones around the Tropics</em>.</li>
<li>The <strong>moisture</strong> is <em>rain</em> and <strong>rain is the earth’s equivalent of water droplets on the outside of a soda can.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The hot water vapor filled air condenses on the “soda can” of the Tropics <em>cold air</em> and clouds form and get saturated with this water until the droplets are <em>so heavy</em> <strong>they fall to earth due to gravity</strong> ==aka <strong>rain</strong>==.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><span style="background:powderblue">Hadley Cells</span></strong> are just really big <span style="background:violet">convection zones</span> located within 30 degrees north or south of the equator ==where rising hot air meets falling cold air==.</li>
<li>These Hadley Cells are located essentially at the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn or ~30 degrees north and south of the equator.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explanation of moisture movement associated with Hadley Cells.
<ul>
<li><strong>The earth’s “air” is really a vapor cloud</strong> consisting of ==water vapor== so when the cold air at the Tropics hits the hot equatorial air <strong>the hot air rapidly cools</strong> and forms <strong>==condensation==</strong> (just like how water droplets appear on the outside of an ice-cold Dr. Pepper can after you open it).</li>

<h5 id="comments-from-the-perspective-of-a-teacher-not-peters-comments">Comments from the Perspective of a <em>Teacher</em> (Not Peter’s Comments)</h5>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What is the <strong>key feature</strong> of all scientific research/inquiry which differentiates it from all other types of human thought?</p>
<p><code>Peter directly addresses this issue on p. 384 of the merged notes.</code></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>The thing students <strong>never</strong> seem to quite understand</em>: The goal of all scientific research is to <strong><code>prove a given hypothesis is wrong.</code></strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>An example hypothesis helps:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Example Hypothesis 1</strong>: “The location of most of Texas’ endangered gray hawks, the Rio Grande Valley, places the Texas gray hawk at high risk of lethal infection by the HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus <strong>because</strong> the Texas gray hawk’s primary location lies directly in the path of the Central North American Flyway of migratory birds infected with HPAI H5N1.”</li>
<li>Most students would take that hypothesis and <strong>go out searching for research which <em>supports</em> the hypothesis</strong>.
<ol type="1">
<li>This “<code>prove the hypothesis right</code>” method of research is <strong><em>entirely wrong</em></strong>.</li>
<li>This incorrect method is <em>completely</em> backwards!</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Now it’s time to introduce the concept of a <code>null hypothesis</code> and its opposite, the <code>alternate hypothesis</code>.
<ol type="1">
<li>Using Example Hypothesis 1 from above, the stated hypothesis is <em>actually</em> the <code>alternate hypothesis</code>.
<ol type="1">
<li>The <strong><code>null hypothesis</code></strong> requires you to restate Example Hypothesis 1 as follows:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Example <em>Null</em> Hypothesis 1:</strong>
<ol type="1">
<li>“The location of the Texas gray hawk in the path of the migratory flyway <strong>does <em>not</em></strong> place these hawks at high risk of lethal HPAI H5N1 2.3.4.4b viral infection.”</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Your goal as a scientist and researcher is to do your very best to <strong>prove yourself wrong</strong> (Peter explains this on p. 387 of the merged notes); stated another way, your goal is to <strong>prove the null hypothesis true</strong>, i.e., to prove that your stated (<code>alternate</code>) hypothesis <strong>false</strong> (thereby proving the <code>null</code> hypothesis <strong>true</strong>). <strong>This is the <em>essence</em> of science</strong>.
<ol type="1">
<li>Stated another way, your goal is to prove the stated hypothesis is <em>wrong</em> and if you <em>fail to prove the stated hypothesis wrong</em> then you can state that you have <strong>failed to prove the null hypothesis true</strong> to some degree or within some margin of statistical error (typically less than 5% probability that your conclusion is wrong).</li>
<li>You <strong>never</strong> claim you have conclusively proven your original hypothesis 100% true.</li>
<li>This is <code>scientific humility</code> or <code>scientific conservatism</code>.</li>
<li>So much scientific research (and writing) is done improperly, failing completely to follow the above <em>central</em> motivation, it’s quite disheartening.
<ol type="1">
<li>The problem, from my viewpoint, is a misplaced confusion between scientific writing and <em>persuasive writing</em> as the latter is taught in K-12 education.</li>
<li>We teach students to state their thesis in the intro and then support the thesis in the body and restate the thesis in the conclusion. <strong>This is wrong</strong>.</li>
<li><code>Selection bias</code> i.e. choosing to cite only research studies which support the proposition that your stated (<code>alternate</code>) hypothesis is <strong>true</strong> is the most common and pervasive problem I see when I read dozens of articles about a given topic. Hardly any of the papers attempt to prove their hypotheses wrong because there is a <code>negative human emotional association</code> that comes into play: Basically, research which succeeds at proper scientific inquiry <code>doesn't get published</code> as much as so-called “positive” research because <strong>according to the major publishers, readers don’t like to read negative results</strong>. This is absolutely ridiculous (the thing which I find ridiculous is that science is willing to bend to market pressures and dilute its integrity so more professors can get more papers published more often in more journals…it’s a massive scam [see the book <em>Profscam</em> for more elaboration])</li>
